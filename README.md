# workout_cron_alert
A random texting alert to remind you to workout with pre-loaded workouts.

Timing and frequency can all be changed within the 'py_cron.py' script. 

The content of the text can be changed within the 'send_text.py' function. I 
have also included 'send_email.py' for sending emails. 

To send the texts, I have found Twilio is the easiest messaging service. Sign up for a free account and you 
get a free phone number and 15.00$ credit. Each text costs 0.0075$ so you get a lot of free texts and you can upgrade later if you want.

## Here is a working example:
